# Coupon System & Mobile Responsiveness Documentation

## Coupon System Functionality

### How the Coupon System Works

1. **Creating Coupons (Admin Dashboard)**
   - Navigate to the Admin Panel
   - Fill in the coupon details:
     - **Coupon Code**: A unique identifier (e.g., WELCOME10)
     - **Discount Percentage**: Up to 10% maximum
     - **Expiration Date**: When the coupon expires
     - **Maximum Uses**: Optional limit on how many times the coupon can be used
   - Click "Create Coupon"

2. **Applying Coupons (Subscription Page)**
   - Go to the Subscription page
   - Enter the coupon code in the "Apply Coupon" section
   - Click "Apply" to validate the coupon
   - The system will show the discount amount and reduced price
   - Proceed with subscription using the discounted price

3. **Pricing Calculation**
   - **Original Subscription Price**: ₹250/month
   - **Discount Calculation**: Original Price × (Discount Percentage / 100)
   - **Final Price**: Original Price - Discount Amount

#### Example Calculations:
- 10% coupon: ₹250 - (₹250 × 0.10) = ₹250 - ₹25 = ₹225
- 5% coupon: ₹250 - (₹250 × 0.05) = ₹250 - ₹12.50 = ₹237.50 (rounded to ₹237)

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Components:
- **Admin.js**: Coupon creation interface
- **Subscription.js**: Coupon application and price calculation

#### Backend Routes:
- **POST /api/coupons**: Create new coupon
- **POST /api/coupons/validate**: Validate coupon code
- **POST /api/payments/create-subscription**: Create subscription with coupon
- **POST /api/payments/create**: Create one-time payment with coupon

#### Data Flow:
1. Admin creates coupon via `/api/coupons`
2. User enters coupon code on Subscription page
3. Frontend validates coupon via `/api/coupons/validate`
4. System calculates discounted price
5. User completes payment with discounted amount
6. Backend tracks coupon usage in database

### Security Features
- Maximum discount limited to 10%
- Coupon expiration dates enforced
- Usage limits (if specified) enforced
- Coupon usage tracked per user

   - Full width on mobile
   - Side-by-side on larger screens

4. **Buttons**
   - Adequate touch targets (minimum 44px)
   - Proper spacing for mobile interaction

### Testing Mobile Responsiveness

To test the mobile responsiveness:
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
4. Test various device sizes:
   - Mobile: iPhone SE, iPhone 12 Pro, Pixel 5
   - Tablet: iPad Mini, iPad Air
   - Desktop: Standard laptop and desktop sizes

### Troubleshooting Mobile Issues

If you encounter any mobile responsiveness issues:
1. Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. Check that all components use responsive classes
3. Verify that custom CSS doesn't override responsive behavior
4. Test on actual devices when possible

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Coupon Not Applying Discount
1. **Check coupon code**: Ensure the code is entered correctly (case-insensitive)
2. **Verify expiration**: Make sure the coupon hasn't expired
3. **Check usage limits**: Ensure the coupon hasn't reached its maximum uses
4. **Validate discount**: Confirm the discount percentage is within limits (1-10%)

### Payment Processing Issues
1. **Check network connection**: Ensure stable internet connection
2. **Verify Razorpay credentials**: Confirm API keys are correctly configured
3. **Check subscription plan**: Ensure the Razorpay plan ID is valid
4. **Review console logs**: Check browser console for error messages

### Mobile Display Problems
1. **Refresh the page**: Clear browser cache and reload
2. **Check viewport meta tag**: Ensure `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` is in the HTML
3. **Test different browsers**: Try Chrome, Safari, Firefox on mobile
4. **Update dependencies**: Ensure all packages are up to date
